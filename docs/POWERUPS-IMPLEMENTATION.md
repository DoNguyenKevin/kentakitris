# Power-ups System Implementation Summary

## ✅ Implementation Complete - ALL SKILLS WORKING!

The power-ups system has been fully implemented in Keltris! All 15 skills are now functional, including the 5 advanced skills that were previously TODO.

## 🎮 How It Works

### Trigger
- **When**: Every level-up (every 10 lines cleared)
- **What**: Game pauses and displays modal with 3 random power-up choices
- **Selection**: Click any card to activate that power-up

### Power-up Types

#### 1. **Instant** (Immediate one-time effect)
- 🔥 **Clear Bottom** - Instantly clears bottom 2 rows
- ⚡ **Laser** - Clears entire highest column
- 🎲 **Random Clear** - Clears 5-10 random blocks
- 🌀 **Teleport** - ✅ Click anywhere on board to place current piece

#### 2. **Duration** (Timed effects)
- ⏰ **Slow Time** (30s) - 50% slower drop speed
- 💰 **Score Boost** (20s) - +50% score multiplier
- ❄️ **Time Freeze** (10s) - Pieces don't drop automatically
- 🔺 **Reverse Gravity** (15s) - ✅ Pieces float up instead of down
- 📏 **Wide Mode** (25s) - ✅ Board expands from 10 to 12 columns

#### 3. **Permanent** (Lasts entire game)
- 👻 **Ghost Mode** - Show piece preview at drop position
- 🔄 **Swap Hold** - Press 'H' to swap current piece with held piece
- 🔮 **Preview+** - See next 3 pieces instead of 1

#### 4. **Passive** (Automatic trigger)
- 🛡️ **Shield** - Save from game over once, clears entire board

#### 5. **Next Piece** (Modifies next piece)
- 💣 **Bomb** - ✅ Next piece creates 3x3 explosion on landing
- ✨ **Magic Block** - ✅ Next piece auto-fills gaps (max 5 blocks)

## 🎨 Rarity System

Power-ups have 4 rarity tiers with different drop rates:

| Rarity | Drop Rate | Color | Power-ups |
|--------|-----------|-------|-----------|
| **Common** | 50% | Gray | Clear Bottom, Slow Time, Ghost Mode |
| **Uncommon** | 30% | Green | Laser, Score Boost, Swap Hold, Shield |
| **Rare** | 15% | Blue | Random Clear, Time Freeze, Preview+ |
| **Legendary** | 5% | Gold (animated) | Teleport, Reverse Gravity, Wide Mode, Bomb, Magic Block |

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Files Modified

1. **index.html** (Main game file)
   - Added power-up modal HTML structure
   - Defined `POWERUPS` constant with all 15 abilities
   - Added game state variables for power-up tracking
   - Implemented core functions:
     - `getRandomPowerups(count)` - Weighted random selection
     - `showPowerupModal()` - Display modal with 3 choices
     - `activatePowerup(powerup)` - Main activation dispatcher
     - `removePowerup(id)` - Cleanup and effect reversal
     - `swapHeldPiece()` - Handle piece swapping for SWAP_PIECE
   - Integrated into level-up trigger in `clearLines()`
   - Updated `startDropInterval()` to use `getCurrentDropDelay()`
   - Updated `endGame()` to handle SHIELD powerup
   - Added 'H' key handler for piece swapping

2. **index.css** (Styling)
   - Added comprehensive powerup modal styles
   - Rarity-based card styling with animations
   - Hover effects and transitions
   - Legendary glow animation
   - Active powerups display (fixed top-right)
   - Responsive design for mobile

3. **POWERUPS-DESIGN.md** (Documentation)
   - Complete design specification
   - All 15 power-ups detailed
   - Technical implementation notes

## 🚧 TODO: Advanced Power-ups

These power-ups are designed but need implementation:

### 1. **Teleport** (Legendary)
- Type: Duration (25s)
- Effect: Click anywhere on board to place current piece
- Implementation needed:
  - Click event handler on board
  - Collision detection at click position
  - Visual indicator for valid placement zones

### 2. **Reverse Gravity** (Legendary)
- Type: Duration (15s)
- Effect: Pieces float up instead of down
- Implementation needed:
  - Invert `movePiece(0, 1)` to `movePiece(0, -1)`
  - Reverse collision detection (check ceiling instead of floor)
  - Lock pieces at top instead of bottom

### 3. **Wide Mode** (Legendary)
- Type: Duration (20s)
- Effect: Expand board from 10 to 15 columns
- Implementation needed:
  - Resize board array dynamically
  - Shift existing pieces to center
  - Update render function for variable width
  - Revert on timeout

### 4. **Bomb** (Legendary)
- Type: Next Piece
- Effect: Next piece clears 3x3 area on landing
- Implementation needed:
  - Flag next piece as "bomb"
  - On `lockPiece()`, detect bomb flag
  - Clear 3x3 area around piece center
  - Visual indicator (💣 emoji or special color)

### 5. **Magic Block** (Legendary)
- Type: Next Piece
- Effect: Next piece auto-fills gaps intelligently
- Implementation needed:
  - AI algorithm to find best placement
  - Detect holes/gaps in board
  - Fill using piece shape optimally
  - Visual indicator (✨ sparkle effect)

## 🎮 Usage

### For Players
1. Play the game normally
2. Clear 10 lines to level up
3. Game pauses and shows 3 power-up choices
4. Click any card to activate that power-up
5. Active duration power-ups show in top-right corner
6. Press 'H' to swap pieces (if you have SWAP_PIECE)

### For Developers
```javascript
// Check if player has a specific powerup
if (hasPowerup('GHOST_MODE')) {
    // Show ghost piece preview
}

// Activate a powerup programmatically
activatePowerup(POWERUPS.LASER);

// Remove a powerup early
removePowerup('SLOW_TIME');

// Get current drop delay (accounts for SLOW_TIME)
const delay = getCurrentDropDelay();
```

## 📊 Balance Notes

Current rarity distribution is:
- Common: 50% (3 powerups)
- Uncommon: 30% (4 powerups)
- Rare: 15% (3 powerups)
- Legendary: 5% (5 powerups)

This means in 100 level-ups, you'll see approximately:
- 150 common powerups
- 90 uncommon powerups
- 45 rare powerups
- 15 legendary powerups

Can adjust `weight` values in `POWERUPS` constant to rebalance.

## 🎨 Customization

### Add New Power-up
1. Add to `POWERUPS` constant:
```javascript
MY_POWERUP: {
    id: 'MY_POWERUP',
    name: 'My Power',
    description: 'Does something cool',
    type: 'instant', // or duration, permanent, passive, nextPiece
    rarity: 'uncommon',
    weight: 30,
    duration: 0 // or time in ms for duration type
}
```

2. Add activation logic in appropriate function:
```javascript
function activateInstantPowerup(powerup) {
    switch (powerup.id) {
        case 'MY_POWERUP':
            // Your logic here
            break;
        // ...
    }
}
```

### Change Rarity Colors
Edit in `index.css`:
```css
.powerup-card[data-rarity="uncommon"] {
    border-color: #YOUR_COLOR;
}
```
