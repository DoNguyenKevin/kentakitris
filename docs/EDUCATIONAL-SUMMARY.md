## 🎯 Educational Features

### Comment Style
- **Language:** Vietnamese (accessible for Vietnamese students)
- **Emoji Markers:** ✅❌❓💡 for visual clarity
- **Structure:**
  - ✅ Mục tiêu (Goal)
  - Cách hoạt động (How it works)
  - Ví dụ (Examples)
  - Try it (Hands-on experimentation)

### Example Comment Pattern
```javascript
/**
 * ✅ Mục tiêu: [Short description]
 * 
 * Cách hoạt động:
 * 1. [Step 1]
 * 2. [Step 2]
 * 3. [Step 3]
 * 
 * Ví dụ: [Concrete example]
 * 
 * Try it: console.log(...);
 */
function exampleFunction() { ... }

// ❓ Câu hỏi: [Question to make students think]
// 💡 Trả lời: [Answer with explanation]
```
