## 🔒 Security & Data Validation

### Validation in loadLeaderboard():
```typescript
// Check if data is array
if (!Array.isArray(parsed)) {
    console.warn('⚠️ Data is not array, reset to empty');
    return [];
}

// Filter only valid entries
const data: LeaderboardEntry[] = parsed.filter(entry => {
    return entry &&
        typeof entry.playerName === 'string' &&
        typeof entry.score === 'number' &&
        typeof entry.lines === 'number' &&
        typeof entry.level === 'number' &&
        typeof entry.timestamp === 'number';
});
```

### Validation in saveScore():
```typescript
// Safe parsing with try-catch
try {
    const parsed = JSON.parse(dataString);
    if (Array.isArray(parsed)) {
        data = parsed.filter(/* validation */);
    }
} catch (parseError) {
    console.warn('⚠️ Cannot parse, starting fresh');
}
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Prevent runtime errors from invalid data
- ✅ Graceful handling of corrupted localStorage
- ✅ Protection from malicious data
- ✅ Automatic recovery on errors

## 📚 Educational Approach

### Vietnamese Comments
Every function has detailed comments:
- **Mục tiêu**: What does this function do?
- **Cách hoạt động**: Step-by-step explanation
- **Ví dụ**: Concrete examples
- **Try it**: How to test

### Questions & Answers
```typescript
// ❓ Câu hỏi: Tại sao dùng JSON.parse()?
// 💡 Trả lời: Vì localStorage chỉ lưu được text (string)!
//            Phải chuyển text → object bằng JSON.parse()
```

## 📝 Data Structure

```typescript
interface LeaderboardEntry {
    playerName: string;  // Player name
    score: number;       // Score
    lines: number;       // Lines cleared
    level: number;       // Level reached
    timestamp: number;   // Time (milliseconds)
}

// Constants
const DEFAULT_PLAYER_NAME = 'Anonymous';
const LEADERBOARD_KEY = 'kentakitris-leaderboard';
const MAX_ENTRIES = 100;
```

Example localStorage data:
```json
[
  {
    "playerName": "KHOI",
    "score": 5000,
    "lines": 50,
    "level": 6,
    "timestamp": 1760620514283
  }
]
```

2. **Data Validation**: Safe localStorage handling with validation and error handling
3. **Constants**: Use constants for easy maintenance and consistency
4. **Best Practices**: Follow Phaser scene lifecycle and TypeScript typing
