# Specification Quality Checklist: Game Settings with Speed Display

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning  
**Created**: October 15, 2025  
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

### Content Quality - PASS
✅ Specification avoids implementation details and focuses on user value  
✅ All sections use business-friendly language  
✅ All mandatory sections (User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria) are complete

### Requirement Completeness - PASS
✅ No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers present - all requirements are concrete  
✅ All functional requirements are specific and testable  
✅ Success criteria include measurable metrics (time, percentage)  
✅ Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no frameworks/APIs mentioned)  
✅ User stories have detailed acceptance scenarios with Given/When/Then format  
✅ Edge cases section addresses boundary conditions and error scenarios  
✅ Out of Scope section clearly defines boundaries  
✅ Assumptions section documents reasonable defaults

### Feature Readiness - PASS
✅ Each functional requirement can be validated through user scenarios  
✅ User stories are prioritized (P1-P3) and independently testable  
✅ Success criteria provide clear measures of feature completion  
✅ Specification maintains business focus without technical implementation details

## Notes

All checklist items passed validation. The specification is complete and ready for the next phase (`/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`).

**Key Strengths**:
- Clear prioritization of user stories from P1 (core value) to P3 (advanced features)
- Comprehensive functional requirements organized by concern area
- Measurable success criteria with specific time/percentage targets
- Well-defined assumptions about settings storage and behavior
- Clear scope boundaries with explicit out-of-scope items
