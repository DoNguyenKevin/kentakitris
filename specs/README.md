## Specification Structure

Each feature/skill follows the speckit template structure:

```
specs/[###-feature-name]/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ spec.md                      # Main specification document
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ User Scenarios & Testing (with priorities)
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Requirements (Functional Requirements, Key Entities)
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Success Criteria (Measurable Outcomes)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ checklists/
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ requirements.md          # Quality validation checklist
```

## Specification Principles

All specifications follow these principles:

‚úÖ **Technology-Agnostic**: No implementation details (frameworks, languages, APIs)  
‚úÖ **User-Focused**: Written for non-technical stakeholders  
‚úÖ **Testable**: All requirements have clear acceptance criteria  
‚úÖ **Measurable**: Success criteria include specific metrics  
‚úÖ **Prioritized**: User stories ordered by importance (P1, P2, P3)  
‚úÖ **Independent**: Each user story is independently testable  
‚úÖ **Edge Cases**: Comprehensive edge case identification  
‚úÖ **Scope-Bounded**: Clear definition of what's included and excluded

## Using These Specifications

These specifications are ready for:
- `/speckit.plan` - Generate implementation plans
- `/speckit.tasks` - Break down into development tasks
- Technical design - Create architecture and implementation details
- Development - Guide coding and implementation
- Testing - Define test cases and acceptance criteria
- Documentation - Source for user guides and technical docs
