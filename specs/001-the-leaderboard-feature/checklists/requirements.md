# Specification Quality Checklist: Leaderboard

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning  
**Created**: 2025-10-15  
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

### Content Quality Review
✅ **PASS** - Specification contains no implementation-specific details (no mention of Firebase, JavaScript, React, or specific APIs). All content focuses on user needs and business outcomes.

### Requirements Review
✅ **PASS** - All 15 functional requirements are:
- Testable (can be verified through observation or measurement)
- Unambiguous (clear, single interpretation)
- Complete (no [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers)

### Success Criteria Review
✅ **PASS** - All 10 success criteria are:
- Measurable (include specific metrics: seconds, percentages, counts)
- Technology-agnostic (no framework or database mentions)
- User/business focused (e.g., "Players can view..." not "API responds in...")

### Acceptance Scenarios Review
✅ **PASS** - All user stories have clearly defined acceptance scenarios using Given-When-Then format. Scenarios cover:
- Primary happy paths
- Alternative flows
- Empty state handling

### Edge Cases Review
✅ **PASS** - Edge cases identified for:
- Boundary conditions (11th player, 10 player limit)
- Duplicate data (identical scores)
- Error conditions (offline, connection failures)
- UI constraints (long usernames)

### Scope & Dependencies Review
✅ **PASS** - Scope is clearly bounded to:
- Top 10 leaderboard display
- Score submission and updates
- Real-time synchronization
- Personal highlighting

Dependencies identified:
- Player authentication (assumed existing system)
- Game completion detection (assumed existing mechanism)

## Overall Assessment

**STATUS**: ✅ **READY FOR PLANNING**

All checklist items pass validation. The specification is:
- Complete and unambiguous
- Free of implementation details
- Focused on user value
- Measurable and testable
- Ready for `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`

## Notes

- Specification assumes existing authentication mechanism (reasonable default: anonymous auth is industry standard for casual games)
- Real-time update requirement (2 second SLA) is reasonable for modern web applications
- Edge cases are well-defined with clear expected behaviors
- User story prioritization follows MVP principles (P1: core functionality, P2: enhanced UX, P3: convenience features)
