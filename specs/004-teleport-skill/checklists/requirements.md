# Specification Quality Checklist: Teleport Skill

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning  
**Created**: 2025-10-15  
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

### Content Quality Review
✅ **PASS** - Specification focuses on user experience and game behavior without mentioning specific technologies or implementation approaches.

### Requirements Review
✅ **PASS** - All 22 functional requirements are:
- Testable (can be verified through gameplay observation)
- Unambiguous (clear single interpretation)
- Complete (no clarification needed)

### Success Criteria Review
✅ **PASS** - All 8 success criteria are:
- Measurable (include specific metrics: seconds, percentages, accuracy)
- Technology-agnostic (no framework mentions)
- User-focused (e.g., "Players can..." not "API responds...")

### Acceptance Scenarios Review
✅ **PASS** - All user stories have clearly defined acceptance scenarios using Given-When-Then format. Scenarios cover:
- Primary happy paths (activate and place)
- Invalid placement handling
- Mode cancellation
- Visual feedback

### Edge Cases Review
✅ **PASS** - Edge cases identified for:
- Boundary conditions (no piece, full board)
- Timing issues (animations, rapid clicks)
- Coordinate accuracy (border clicks)
- Game state conflicts (pause, piece lock)

### Scope & Dependencies Review
✅ **PASS** - Scope is clearly bounded to:
- Click-to-place mechanic
- One-time instant power-up
- Visual indicators
- Collision validation

Dependencies identified:
- Existing collision detection system
- DOM board element for coordinate calculation

## Overall Assessment

**STATUS**: ✅ **READY FOR PLANNING**

All checklist items pass validation. The specification is:
- Complete and unambiguous
- Free of implementation details
- Focused on user value
- Measurable and testable
- Ready for `/speckit.plan` or implementation

## Notes

- Specification assumes existing collision detection can be reused (reasonable based on game architecture)
- Visual indicators (purple glow, cursor change) follow standard game UI patterns
- One-time use model is consistent with other instant power-ups in the game
- Edge cases cover all major scenarios including timing and coordination issues
