# Specification Quality Checklist: Bomb Skill

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning  
**Created**: 2025-10-15  
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

### Content Quality Review
✅ **PASS** - Specification focuses on bomb behavior and explosion mechanics without mentioning specific code implementations or technical details.

### Requirements Review
✅ **PASS** - All 32 functional requirements are:
- Testable (can be verified through gameplay observation)
- Unambiguous (clear explosion mechanics and behaviors)
- Complete (no clarification needed)

### Success Criteria Review
✅ **PASS** - All 8 success criteria are:
- Measurable (include specific metrics: seconds, percentages, accuracy rates)
- Technology-agnostic (no implementation mentions)
- User-focused (e.g., "Players can..." and "Bomb explosions clear...")

### Acceptance Scenarios Review
✅ **PASS** - All user stories have clearly defined acceptance scenarios using Given-When-Then format. Scenarios cover:
- Bomb activation and marking
- Normal piece control
- Explosion trigger and area clearing
- Boundary handling at edges
- Visual effects
- Line clearing integration

### Edge Cases Review
✅ **PASS** - Edge cases identified for:
- Empty area explosions
- Multiple bombs (if applicable)
- Timing conflicts (other power-ups, pieces in motion)
- Board positions (first piece, spawn area effects)
- Special modes (reverse gravity, other modifiers)
- Multi-block pieces (center definition)

### Scope & Dependencies Review
✅ **PASS** - Scope is clearly bounded to:
- Next piece type modifier (one-time use)
- 3x3 explosion area on lock
- Block clearing and falling
- Line clearing integration
- Visual indicators

Dependencies identified:
- Existing lockPiece() function
- Piece marking capability
- Collision and gravity systems

## Overall Assessment

**STATUS**: ✅ **READY FOR PLANNING**

All checklist items pass validation. The specification is:
- Complete and unambiguous
- Free of implementation details
- Focused on user experience and gameplay mechanics
- Measurable and testable
- Ready for `/speckit.plan` or implementation

## Notes

- Specification clearly defines the 3x3 explosion mechanics and boundary handling
- Edge case handling is comprehensive, covering board positions and timing scenarios
- Success criteria balance technical accuracy (100% correct clearing) with user experience (80% strategic understanding)
- User story prioritization follows MVP principles (P1: activation and explosion, P2: boundaries, P3: integration and polish)
- Assumptions clearly state that bomb marking can be done via piece flags/properties
