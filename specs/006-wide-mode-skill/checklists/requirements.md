# Specification Quality Checklist: Wide Mode Skill

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning  
**Created**: 2025-10-15  
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

### Content Quality Review
✅ **PASS** - Specification focuses on board behavior and gameplay dynamics without mentioning specific implementation technologies or data structures.

### Requirements Review
✅ **PASS** - All 38 functional requirements are:
- Testable (can be verified through gameplay and visual inspection)
- Unambiguous (clear expansion/contraction mechanics)
- Complete (no clarification needed)

### Success Criteria Review
✅ **PASS** - All 8 success criteria are:
- Measurable (include specific metrics: seconds, percentages, accuracy rates)
- Technology-agnostic (no framework or code mentions)
- User-focused (e.g., "Players can..." and "Board expansion preserves...")

### Acceptance Scenarios Review
✅ **PASS** - All user stories have clearly defined acceptance scenarios using Given-When-Then format. Scenarios cover:
- Board expansion activation
- Block preservation and centering
- Piece spawning and movement in wide mode
- Line clearing adaptation
- Timer expiration and contraction
- UI rendering

### Edge Cases Review
✅ **PASS** - Edge cases identified for:
- Timing issues (expiration during piece placement)
- Piece positioning (current piece in outer columns)
- Board state (nearly full board, multiple activations)
- Interactions (line completion, combined power-ups)
- Display constraints (screen size limits)

### Scope & Dependencies Review
✅ **PASS** - Scope is clearly bounded to:
- 25-second duration power-up
- 10 to 12 column expansion (and back)
- Block preservation during expansion
- Block removal during contraction
- Rendering adaptation

Dependencies identified:
- Dynamic board data structure capability
- Rendering system that can adapt to width changes
- Collision detection system

## Overall Assessment

**STATUS**: ✅ **READY FOR PLANNING**

All checklist items pass validation. The specification is:
- Complete and unambiguous
- Free of implementation details
- Focused on user experience and gameplay mechanics
- Measurable and testable
- Ready for `/speckit.plan` or implementation

## Notes

- Specification clearly defines the centering strategy (1 column added each side) for block preservation
- Edge case handling for outer column blocks during contraction is well-defined (removal policy)
- 25-second duration provides sufficient time for strategic gameplay
- Success criteria balance technical accuracy (100% block preservation) with user experience (75% strategy usefulness)
- User story prioritization follows MVP principles (P1: expansion and preservation, P2: integration, P3: polish)
