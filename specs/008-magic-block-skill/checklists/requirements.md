# Specification Quality Checklist: Magic Block Skill

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning  
**Created**: 2025-10-15  
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

### Content Quality Review
✅ **PASS** - Specification focuses on gap-filling behavior and smart placement mechanics without mentioning specific code implementations or technical details.

### Requirements Review
✅ **PASS** - All 40 functional requirements are:
- Testable (can be verified through gameplay observation)
- Unambiguous (clear gap detection and filling mechanics)
- Complete (no clarification needed)

### Success Criteria Review
✅ **PASS** - All 8 success criteria are:
- Measurable (include specific metrics: seconds, percentages, accuracy rates)
- Technology-agnostic (no implementation mentions)
- User-focused (e.g., "Players can..." and "Gap detection identifies...")

### Acceptance Scenarios Review
✅ **PASS** - All user stories have clearly defined acceptance scenarios using Given-When-Then format. Scenarios cover:
- Magic block activation and marking
- Normal piece control
- Gap detection on landing
- Smart filling with priority
- Priority algorithm behavior
- Line clearing integration
- Visual effects

### Edge Cases Review
✅ **PASS** - Edge cases identified for:
- Empty scenarios (no gaps, exactly 5 gaps)
- Board states (nearly full, scattered gaps)
- Multiple magic blocks (if applicable)
- Gap creation (piece placement creates gaps)
- Line completion (gaps in same row)
- Special modes (reverse gravity)
- Cascading effects (filled gaps enable more clears)

### Scope & Dependencies Review
✅ **PASS** - Scope is clearly bounded to:
- Next piece type modifier (one-time use)
- Up to 5 gaps filled per activation
- Priority-based gap selection
- Automatic smart placement
- Line clearing integration

Dependencies identified:
- Existing lockPiece() function
- Piece marking capability
- Board scanning and analysis system

## Overall Assessment

**STATUS**: ✅ **READY FOR PLANNING**

All checklist items pass validation. The specification is:
- Complete and unambiguous
- Free of implementation details
- Focused on user experience and gameplay mechanics
- Measurable and testable
- Ready for `/speckit.plan` or implementation

## Notes

- Specification clearly defines the gap detection and priority algorithm requirements
- Maximum 5 gaps provides good balance between power and gameplay balance
- Edge case handling is comprehensive, covering various board states and scenarios
- Success criteria balance technical accuracy (100% gap detection) with user experience (80% understanding)
- User story prioritization follows MVP principles (P1: activation and filling, P2: priority and integration, P3: polish)
- Assumptions clearly state the smart filling approach with depth-first priority
