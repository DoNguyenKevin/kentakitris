# Specification Quality Checklist: Difficulty Selection System

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning  
**Created**: October 15, 2025  
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Summary

**Status**: âœ… PASSED - Specification is ready for planning phase

**Validation Date**: October 15, 2025

**Key Strengths**:
- Clear prioritization of user stories (P1-P4) with independent testability
- Comprehensive functional requirements (FR-001 through FR-018) covering all difficulty levels
- Technology-agnostic success criteria focused on user experience and measurable outcomes
- Well-defined edge cases addressing potential game state conflicts
- Detailed assumptions section documenting reasonable defaults

**Notes**:
- All checklist items passed on first validation
- No implementation details present - specification maintains focus on WHAT and WHY
- Each difficulty level has clear acceptance scenarios
- Success criteria are measurable and verifiable (e.g., "within 5 seconds", "exactly 3 seconds", "90% of beginners")
- Specification is ready for `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`
