# Specification Quality Checklist: Reverse Gravity Skill

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning  
**Created**: 2025-10-15  
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

### Content Quality Review
✅ **PASS** - Specification focuses on gameplay behavior and user experience without mentioning specific code implementations or technical details.

### Requirements Review
✅ **PASS** - All 32 functional requirements are:
- Testable (can be verified through gameplay observation)
- Unambiguous (clear mechanics and behaviors)
- Complete (no clarification needed)

### Success Criteria Review
✅ **PASS** - All 8 success criteria are:
- Measurable (include specific metrics: seconds, percentages, accuracy rates)
- Technology-agnostic (no implementation mentions)
- User-focused (e.g., "Players can..." and "Collision detection works...")

### Acceptance Scenarios Review
✅ **PASS** - All user stories have clearly defined acceptance scenarios using Given-When-Then format. Scenarios cover:
- Gravity inversion activation
- Spawn position changes
- Collision and movement behavior
- Hard drop modifications
- Timer expiration and restoration
- Line clearing integration

### Edge Cases Review
✅ **PASS** - Edge cases identified for:
- Timing issues (mid-movement expiration, lock delay)
- Power-up interactions (Time Freeze, multiple gravity effects)
- Spawn blocking scenarios (bottom and top)
- Complex game states (rotation near ceiling, obstacles)

### Scope & Dependencies Review
✅ **PASS** - Scope is clearly bounded to:
- 15-second duration power-up
- Gravity direction inversion
- Spawn position adjustment
- Collision detection inversion
- Hard drop direction reversal

Dependencies identified:
- Game tick system for piece movement
- Existing collision detection logic
- Spawn position calculation system

## Overall Assessment

**STATUS**: ✅ **READY FOR PLANNING**

All checklist items pass validation. The specification is:
- Complete and unambiguous
- Free of implementation details
- Focused on user experience and gameplay mechanics
- Measurable and testable
- Ready for `/speckit.plan` or implementation

## Notes

- Specification assumes existing collision and movement systems can be inverted (reasonable architectural assumption)
- 15-second duration provides enough time for meaningful gameplay without being overwhelming
- Edge cases comprehensively cover timing and interaction scenarios
- User story prioritization follows MVP principles (P1: core inversion, P2: controls and timers, P3: integration with other systems)
- Success criteria include both technical accuracy (100% collision detection) and user experience metrics (80% player adaptation)
